			<p class="w3-opacity"><i>The program for every basketball player</i></p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				HOOP UP, designed and coded by Shannon Lau, is a basketball tracking program that records and processes in-game statistics using a Python back-end.
				After creating an account, the user is able to input each game's statistics and ultimately view their progress in data charts powered by Google Charts.
				The program produces numbers and facts concerning your overall game and compares games side-by-side for in-depth analysis.
				With the use of this simplistically programmed software, the user can develop his or her game to become a better player.
				Know your game, know your grounds.
				Let's HOOP UP.

			<h2 class="w3-wide unica-one">CREDITS</h2>
			<p class="w3-opacity"><i>A special thanks to...</i></p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				Google Charts: Serving as one of the main features, the charts were provided by Google Charts, an accessible library of various display functions used in Javascript.
				The program explained the Javascript code that is incorporated into HOOP UP.
			</p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				w3.CSS: This site is the source of inspiration in designing HOOP UP, as seen in the layout of this webpage.
				Using an external style sheet from w3.CSS, HOOP UP was created.
				This website was <i>not</i> built off an HTML template, however--just created on pure OCD for aesthetics, simplicity and perfection.
			</p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				Helen Li: This girl, without whom this project would be <i>impossible</i>, deserves her name on this more than I do.
				Her moral support is appreciated so so (SO) much, especially during those rough times of Internal Server Errors and dysfunctional charts.
				Thank you for believing in me when I couldn't.
			</p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				Mr. Brooks: The legend, the man himself, Mr. Brooks. Thank you for pushing me to do this project.
				Your assistance as a teacher this year has been essential to HOOP UP and all the code in it.
				You've made me love computer science like no other love.
			</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h2 class="w3-wide unica-one">NOTE FROM THE PROGRAMMER</h2>
			<p class="w3-opacity"><i>From the bottom of my heart (not really)</i></p>
			<p class="w3-justify">
				My aim for HOOP UP was to create a successful website with no bugs that could produce a full visualization of a basketball player's progress and statistics.
				As a striving athlete myself, I regard stat-tracking very highly, so I hold this project and concept very close to my heart.
				After three nights of relentless labor, a million Internal Server Errors, and several hours of sleep, I present to you my masterpiece, HOOP UP.
				I hope you enjoy it and much as I do.
